# HallowScript-Text-Editor
Hello! As you can probably tell by the title, I'm making a text editor for the Hollow Knight language HallowScript. Feel free to edit my terrible code, I'm still not that familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The majority of my code comes from various tutorials I found. This is my first serious project with the languages. Also, you may have noticed that I don't have a HallowScript font. This is because I don't know how to read/speak HallowScript, and I also don't know how to make fonts. If anyone reading this knows where I can find a HallowScript font, please do tell me. Thanks! :) - Haevern
